# Website Considerations

Earlier before, I used to use Hugo for my static site generation.
Hugo was nice since I was able to write my main content in markdown and had Hugo use the theme to generate what I wanted on the fly.

However, I wanted to revamp my portfolio page, so I initially used v0 to generate the Three.js DNA strand that you see on the front page, as well as the rest of the layout. This led to some issues however, namely with my blog portion of my website. I really enjoy writing and want my portfolio to reflect that while also looking nice, so I set out to develop a blogging system similar to what Hugo does with Markdown. 

## Answer: MDX
MDX was a way for me to embed markdown into my Next.js website.
